## Project Overview:
The objective of this project is to develop a calendar application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and Express.js, with the potential incorporation of other frameworks.
## Project Description:
We aim to create a user-friendly calendar where individuals can input tasks, notes, or appointments. This application will function as a single-page platform allowing seamless interaction with the calendar and the ability to filter/sort through various entries.
## Architecture Overview:
Our solution will utilize a backend powered by Node.js and Express.js, coupled with frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Post initial development, we'll refine the application further by integrating frameworks such as React or Next.js to enhance functionality and user experience.
